I followed this Tutorial from a Youtuber - dcode 

Concepts learned in this 
- CSS Grid
- Event Listeners
- Creating HTML Elements Dynamically and adding to the DOM.
- Local Storage

Although it was a code along, I feel that my knowledge for JS is getting better by building a simple app.
I will definitely will recreate this by my own without the help of video soon.
